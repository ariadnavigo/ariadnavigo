Hi there! 
I'm Ariadna and I'm mostly a hobbyist when it comes to coding. 
I actually work in the publishing industry and I was trained as a linguist 😅

I'm mostly interested in writing things in POSIX C and shell that are useful for myself,
but I do hope they might also be helpful for you as well! 💝

I'm always open to contributions to my projects!
If you've got any improvements or ideas, don't hesitate in chiming in!

With love,
Ariadna 💖
